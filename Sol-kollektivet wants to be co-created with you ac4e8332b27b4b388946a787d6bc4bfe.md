**We are looking for someone to co-create a co-living space in lushy Sj√∂viksskogen (13 minutes from T-Centralen)**

You would be joining a newly formed and sunny co-living place ‚òÄÔ∏è.  The idea of the place is for humans to connect, and have fun and meaningful conversations. And we want you to live here.

The people who currently live here are:

- Camilla Wedenstam. Camilla is 32 y/o, and works for the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, Sida. Besides her interest in world politics and issues such as leadership, sustainability and human rights, she is much into yoga, meditation and personal development. She is a curious soul, who loves engaging with new people that both shares her interest but also adds new dimensions and topics to explore.
- Tamar Ravestein. Tamar has a MSc in nutrition, is working at Bangerhead with marketing and has a passion for nature and a certain Australian boy here in Stockholm.

Josie and Camilla hopes to find a flatmate who shares their vision of the collective; a place to wind down, to create a fun and loving atmosphere and spend time together cooking, going out, exploring the city, and engage in various adventures.    

Highlights of the place:

- 13 minutes to T-Centralen (7 minutes walk + 6 min 2 stop train ride)
- Secluded location, 10 meters to Sj√∂viksskogen, which has a small lake, wild rabbits and beer, and view of Liljeholmsviken üêá ü¶å
- Well planned, 2 large balconies, windows facing 3 directions (lots of ‚òÄÔ∏è)
- Budget to pay for furniture, fixing etc in common rooms, and most things in personal rooms, and to have dinners together
- The apartment has a washing machine, dishwasher, bath tub etc.
- Biweekly cleaning, internet etc included in rent.

Things that would make you a good fit:

- You love organizing things and co-creating a nice place, and want to stay here for 1+ years
- You like to have an extra family to come home to and think it's fun to have people around to chat with when at home
- You have lived in co-living places before and understand that keeping things neat together requires amazing and responsible co-livers who take care of and cover for each other ‚ù§Ô∏è

Also, if you are into yoga, mindfulness, and/or tech you will be surrounded by likeminded people üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The rent is 5400 kr, 6600 kr and 8400 kr for the respective rooms. We are currently looking for someone to take the largest room. This room has it‚Äôs own balcony, seen in the picture above, and walk-in closet.
